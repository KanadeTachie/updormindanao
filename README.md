VERSION 1.1 Updated with PHP for Account Creation
Initial commit was actually with working PHP. 
1. Changed .HTML to  .PHP fo PHP to work. 
2. Displays "Connected!" and "Account Created!" below when sign up button is pressed. "Account already exists!" when there is the same email in the database.

NEEDS: Frontend fix for account creation and account already existing, preferably a bootstrap modal.S
